# Imaginary Friends Forum

This is a single-page app where you can anonymously post an imaginary friend, like and/or comment on others' imaginary friends.  There is no user sign-up involved.

## Usage

This app is hosted on Heroku at: https://imaginary-friends-forum.herokuapp.com/

After going to that URL, you will see all imaginary friends that everyone has posted.

## Contributing

Please utilize the "dev" branch for all contributions; submit all pull requests to that branch, any pull requests to the "master" branch will be denied, as that is the production codebase for the live web-site.

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/kerneltux0/imaginary_friends_forum. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.
